# CSSCat [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ryanfitzer/csscat.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ryanfitzer/csscat) #

CSSCat is a [Node.js][nodejs] tool for managing CSS dependencies. Its goal is to facilitate CSS modularity through the liberal use of `@import` statements ([including ones with media conditions][mqs]) during development that can then be concatenated into single files for production.

**Why not just use one of the various CSS preprocessors available these days**, you ask? Good question. I wrote CSSCat for those who don't use a preprocessor and/or for when a project's limitations exclude a preprocessor as an option. Since CSSCat operates on valid CSS, switching to another tool is simple.

**CSSCat IS IN THE ALPHA STAGES**. So please use with caution. Due to its file transformation functionality, it should only be used in a manner that does not jeopardize your valuable work. More testing and real-world use is needed to ensure a solid tool that functions as advertised.

With that said, testers are needed (and much appreciated)! Please log any issues or features and I'll follow up as soon as possible.


## Features ##

- Concatenates file dependencies by parsing their `@import` statements ([including ones with media conditions][mqs]). CSSCat correctly wraps the imported CSS in its equivalent `@media` block. For example:

    **Before**:

        @import url( 'a.css' ) screen and ( min-width: 100px );


    **After**:

        @media screen and ( min-width: 100px ) {
        #some-id {
            display:awesome;
        }       
        }

- Rewrites relative asset paths to reference new context.
- Optionally optimizes each file via [CSSMin][CSSMin].


## Installation ##

    $ npm install csscat


## Options ##

- `dir` {String} The base path (relative to the file from which `csscat.init` is invoked) used to search for all files with a "css" extension.

- `files` {Array} (Optional) An array of files to use instead of searching the `dir` path.   

    - If the paths are not absolute, they must be relative to the file from which `csscat.init` is invoked.
    - If the `dir` path is defined, the paths cannot be absolute, they must be relative to the `dir` path.

- `optimize` {Boolean} Minify via CSSMin.

- `exclude` {RegEx} Regex exclusion pattern used to filter the list of files to process. Defaults to `/^\.|\/\.|node_modules/`, which filters out anything that begins with "." or "node_modules". **NOTE**: If an excluded file is a dependency of a non-excluded file, the file will be parsed. See the `ignore` option for an alternative way to skip files.

- `ignore` {Array} Array of strings to match against when parsing the `@import` statements of a file. If a match is found, the file and all of the ancestor files in its dependency chain will be skipped.

- `log` {Boolean} Disable logging. Defaults to `true`.

- `debug` {Boolean} Enable debug logging. Defaults to `false`.


## Usage ##

**Note**: CSSCat does not copy the files into a new directory before processing. This [gist][copy-files] shows how to use CSSCat's fs-helper in a build.js file to easily generate a copy of the original directory.

    var csscat = require( 'csscat' );
    
    var files = csscat.init({
        dir: 'path/to/css' // relative to the file from which `csscat.init` is invoked
    });
    

The call to `init` returns a files object. Here's an example:

    {
        data: {
            'absolute/path/to/file-1.css': {
                skip: false,
                imports: {
                    'absolute/path/to/file-4.css': {
                        statement: '@import url( \'dependency/file-4.css\' ) screen and ( min-width: 100px );',
                        path: 'dependency/file.css',
                        rule: '@import url( \'dependency/file-4.css\' );',
                        condition: 'screen and ( min-width: 100px )'
                    },
                    {...}
                }
            },
            {...},
            {...}
        },
        order: [
            'absolute/path/to/file-1.css',
            'absolute/path/to/file-2.css',
            'absolute/path/to/file-3.css',
            'absolute/path/to/file-4.css',
        ]
    }

### The `data` Object ###

The `data` object stores information on each file. The file's absolute path is represented as a key.

- `skip` {Boolean} If the file was skipped for any reason. A file is skipped if one of its dependencies can not be resolved. This is due to using non-relative paths (absolute/URLs) in an `@import` statement or one of its `@import` statement's paths was found in the options `ignore` array.
- `imports` {Object} Information on each of the file's dependencies.
    - `statement` {String} The full `@import` statement as found in the source.
    - `path` {String} The original path found in the `@import` statement.
    - `rule` {String} The `@import` rule, sans any media condition.
    - `condition` {String} The media condition. Empty string if no media condition is found.

### The `order` Array ###

The `order` array is an ordered list of files (absolute paths) that have been processed. The order is determined by the dependency tree. Skipped files are not included.


## Testing ##

I'm still in the process of writing tests. If you have a particular test you feel should added, please open an issue.

### OSX ###

    $ cd path/to/where/you/installed/csscat
    $ npm test

### Windows ###

Since Windows does not recognize executables the same as OSX you need to run the following:

    $ cd path\to\where\you\installed\csscat
    $ node node_modules/.bin/mocha --reporter list --require should tests

### Running the Smoke Test ###

I've also created a simple smoke-test to be viewed in the browser, which allows for easy visual debugging. If you find a particular scenario in your css organization that fails, open an issue and I'll add it to the smoke-test.

    $ cd path/to/where/you/installed/csscat
    $ node smoke-test/test.sample

#### Viewing the Results ####

A new directory will be created in the smoke-test directory named "sample-build". Open the enclosed "index.html" in a browser.

#### Reading the Results ####

*PASS*: All text is green. A green checkmark image to the left of each item's text.

*FAIL*: Red text and/or red "x" image (or no "x" image) to the left of each item's text.


## Roadmap ##

- Compatibility with other tools ([RequireJS][requirejs], [Grunt][grunt]) (in progress).
- Converting images to `data-uri` via some sort of flag in the property.
- [Source map][source-maps-html5rocks] generation ([more explanation][source-maps-snugug]). Mozilla [has a nodejs package][moz-source-map].
