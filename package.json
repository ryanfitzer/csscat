Its goal is to facilitate CSS modularity through the liberal use of `@import` statements ([including ones with media conditions][mqs]) during development that can then be concatenated into single files for production.\n\nInstead of creating long manifests of files that need to be concatenated together by a build tool, CSSCat does this for you by tracing the dependency tree by reading a file's `@import` statements. This enables you to leverage `@import` statements during development and concatenated/minified CSS in production. And without having to rewrite your `<link>` tags to point to \"some-file.min.css\".\n\n**Why not just use one of the various CSS preprocessors available these days**, you ask? Good question. I wrote CSSCat for those who don't use a preprocessor and/or for when a project's limitations exclude a preprocessor as an option. Since CSSCat operates on valid CSS, switching to another tool is simple.\n\n**Note**: CSSCat does not copy the project files into a new directory before processing. This [gist][copy-files] shows how to use CSSCat's `fsh` module in your build.js file to easily generate a copy of the your project.\n\n**CSSCat IS IN THE ALPHA STAGES**. So please use with caution. Due to its file transformation functionality, it should only be used in a manner that does not jeopardize your valuable work. More testing and real-world use is needed to ensure a solid tool that functions as advertised.\n\nWith that said, testers are needed (and much appreciated)! Please log any issues or features and I'll follow up as soon as possible.\n\n\n## Features ##\n\n- Concatenates file dependencies by parsing their `@import` statements ([including ones with media conditions][mqs]). CSSCat correctly wraps the imported CSS in its equivalent `@media` block. For example:\n\n    **Before**:\n\n        @import url( 'a.css' ) screen and ( min-width: 100px );\n\n\n    **After**:\n\n        @media screen and ( min-width: 100px ) {\n        #some-id {\n            display:awesome;\n        }       \n        }\n\n- Rewrites relative asset paths to reference new context.\n- Optionally optimizes each file via [CSSMin][CSSMin].\n\n\n## Installation ##\n\n    $ npm install csscat\n\n\n## Usage ##\n\nThe only option needed to get started is the `dir` option. The path you provide should be relative to the file from which `csscat.init( options )` is invoked. The following configuration will process all files located in \"my/css\" and its subdirectories.\n\n```js\n    var csscat = require( 'csscat' );\n    \n    csscat.init({\n        dir: 'my/css'\n    });\n```\n\nYou can also supply only a `files` option. Just like the `dir` option, the path should be relative to the file from which `csscat.init( options )` is invoked. The following configuration will process \"a.css\", \"b.css\", \"c.css\".\n\nPlease be aware that since CSSCat follows the dependency tree using the file's `@import` statements, any `@import` statements found pointing to files not listed in the `files` array will cause those files to also be processed.\n\n```js\n    var csscat = require( 'csscat' );\n    \n    csscat.init({\n        files: [\n            'my/css/a.css',\n            'my/css/b.css',\n            'my/css/c.css'\n        ]\n    });\n```\n\nYou can use the `ignore` option to insure that certain files are skipped. The strings found in the `ignore` array are matched against the values in `@import` statements. If a file's `@import` statement contains a match to one of these strings, that file and all of its ancestors (the files that import it) are skipped. This is needed to avoid creating invalid CSS.\n\n```js\n    var csscat = require( 'csscat' );\n    \n    csscat.init({\n        dir: 'my/css',\n        ignore: [ 'd.css' ]\n    });\n```\n\nThe `exclude` option enables you to exclude certain files and directories via regular expression matching. Be aware that, like the earlier example,  any `@import` statements found pointing to files meant for exclusion will still be processed.\n\n```js\n        var csscat = require( 'csscat' );\n    \n        csscat.init({\n            dir: 'my/css',\n            exclude: /pattern/\n        });\n```\n\n\n## Options ##\n\n- `dir` {String} The base path (relative to the file from which `csscat.init` is invoked) used to search for all files with a \"css\" extension.\n\n- `files` {Array} (Optional) An array of files to use instead of searching the `dir` path.   \n\n    - If the paths are not absolute, they must be relative to the file from which `csscat.init` is invoked.\n    - If the `dir` path is defined, the paths cannot be absolute, they must be relative to the `dir` path.\n\n- `optimize` {Boolean} Minify via CSSMin.\n\n- `exclude` {RegEx} Regex exclusion pattern used to filter the list of files to process. Defaults to `/^\\.|\\/\\.|node_modules/`, which filters out anything that begins with \".\" or \"node_modules\". **NOTE**: If an excluded file is a dependency of a non-excluded file, the file will be parsed. See the `ignore` option for an alternative way to skip files.\n\n- `ignore` {Array} Array of strings to match against when parsing the `@import` statements of a file. If a match is found, the file and all of the ancestor files in its dependency chain will be skipped.\n\n- `log` {Boolean} Disable logging. Defaults to `true`.\n\n- `debug` {Boolean} Enable debug logging. Defaults to `false`.\n\n\n## The Files Object ##\n\nThe call to `csscat.init( options )` returns a files object containing the `data` and `order` members.\n\n### The `data` Object ###\n\nThe `data` object stores information on each file. The file's absolute path is represented as a key.\n\n- `skip` {Boolean} If the file was skipped for any reason. A file is skipped if one of its dependencies can not be resolved. This is due to using non-relative paths (absolute/URLs) in an `@import` statement or one of its `@import` statement's paths was found in the options `ignore` array.\n- `imports` {Object} Information on each of the file's dependencies.\n    - `statement` {String} The full `@import` statement as found in the source.\n    - `path` {String} The original path found in the `@import` statement.\n    - `rule` {String} The `@import` rule, sans any media condition.\n    - `condition` {String} The media condition. Empty string if no media condition is found.\n\n### The `order` Array ###\n\nThe `order` array is an ordered list of files (absolute paths) that have been processed. The order is determined by the dependency tree. Skipped files are not included.\n\n\n## Testing ##\n\n### OSX ###\n\n    $ cd path/to/where/you/installed/csscat\n    $ npm test\n\n### Windows ###\n\nSince Windows does not recognize executables the same as OSX you need to run the following:\n\n    $ cd path\\to\\where\\you\\installed\\csscat\n    $ node node_modules/.bin/mocha --reporter list --require should tests\n\n#### Viewing the Results in the Browser ####\n\nEach test in \"tests/options/actual\" be viewed in the browser, which allows for easy visual debugging. Simply drag the test's \"index.html\" file to your browser. If you find a particular scenario in your css organization that fails, open an issue.\n\n#### Reading the Results ####\n\n*PASS*: All text is green. A green checkmark image to the left of each item's text.\n\n*FAIL*: Red text and/or red \"x\" image (or no \"x\" image) to the left of each item's text.\n\n\n## Roadmap ##\n\n- Compatibility with other tools ([RequireJS][requirejs], [Grunt][grunt]) (almost done with the GruntJS plugin).\n- Converting images to `data-uri` via some sort of flag in the property.\n- [Source map][source-maps-html5rocks] generation ([more explanation][source-maps-snugug]). Mozilla [has a nodejs package][moz-source-map].\n\n\n[nodejs]: http://nodejs.org/\n[mqs]: http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/#media0\n[copy-files]: https://gist.github.com/ryanfitzer/5202101\n[CSSMin]: https://github.com/yui/ycssmin\n[requirejs]: http://requirejs.org/\n[grunt]: http://gruntjs.com/\n[data-uri]:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/data_URIs\n[source-maps-html5rocks]:http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/developertools/sourcemaps/\n[moz-source-map]: https://github.com/mozilla/source-map\n[source-maps-snugug]:http://snugug.com/musings/debugging-sass-source-maps\n"}
