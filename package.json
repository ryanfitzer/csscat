  "readme": "# CSSCat #\n\n  CSSCat is a [Node.js][nodejs] tool for managing CSS dependencies. Its goal is to facilitate CSS modularity through the liberal use of `@import` statements ([including ones with media conditions][mqs]) during development that can then be built into single files for production.\n\n  **Why not just use one of the various CSS preprocessors available these days**, you ask? Good question. I wrote CSSCat for those who don't use a preprocessor and/or for when a project's limitations exclude a preprocessor as an option. Since CSSCat operates on valid CSS, switching to another tool is simple.\n\n  **CSSCat IS IN THE ALPHA STAGES**. So please use with caution. Due to its file transformation functionality, it should only be used in a manner that does not jeopardize your valuable work. More testing and real-world use is needed to ensure a solid tool that functions as advertised.\n\n  With that said, testers are needed (and much appreciated)! Please log any issues or features and I'll follow up as soon as possible.\n\n\n  ## Features ##\n\n  - Concatenates file dependencies by parsing their `@import` statements ([including ones with media conditions][mqs]). CSSCat correctly wraps the imported CSS in its equivalent `@media` block. For example:\n\n      **Before**:\n\n          @import url( 'a.css' ) screen and ( min-width: 100px );\n\n\n      **After**:\n\n          @media screen and ( min-width: 100px ) {\n          #some-id {\n              display:awesome;\n          }       \n          }\n\n  - Rewrites relative asset paths to reference new context.\n  - Optimizes each file via [CSSMin][CSSMin].\n\n\n  ## Installation ##\n\n      $ npm install csscat\n\n\n  ## Usage ##\n\n      var csscat = require( 'csscat' );\n\n      csscat.init({\n          dir: 'path/to/css'\n      });\n\n\n  **Note**: CSSCat does not copy the files into a new directory before processing. This [gist][copy-files] shows how to use CSSCat's fs-helper in a build.js file to easily generate a copy of the original directory.\n\n  ## Options ##\n\n  - `dir` {String} The base path (relative to the file from which `csscat.init` is invoked) used to search for all files with a \"css\" extension.\n\n  - `files` {Array} (Optional) An array of files to use instead of searching the `dir` path. The paths must be relative to the `dir` path.\n\n  - `optimize` {Boolean} Minify via CSSMin.\n\n  - `exclude` {RegEx} Regex exclusion pattern used to filter the results. Defaults to `/^\\.|\\/\\.|node_modules/`, which filters out anything that begins with \".\" or \"node_modules\".\n\n  - `debug` {Boolean} Enable verbose logging. Defaults to `false`.\n\n\n  ## Testing ##\n\n  While I develop more robust tests, I've created a simple smoke-test to be viewed in the browser. If successful, the page will show 3 green checkmarks next to green text of the individual filenames. If unsuccessful, the possible states are:\n\n  - A red \"x\" image (or no image at all) in place of the green checkmark. This means the relative asset paths were not correctly rewritten to reference their new context.\n  - The filename text will be red, meaning the file was not properly imported.\n\n  Viewing the results in the browser allows for easy debugging until I can get proper unit tests developed. If you find a particular scenario in your css that fails, let me know and I'll update the smoke-test. \n\n  To run the tests:\n\n      $ cd path/to/where/you/installed/csscat\n      $ node smoke-test/test.sample\n\n  If you're browser does not automatically open index.html (currently OSX only), use the following url:\n\n      file://path/to/where/you/installed/csscat/tests/sample-build/index.html\n\n\n  ## Roadmap ##\n\n  - Proper unit testing.\n  - Cross-platform testing (I've only tested OSX, so far).\n  - Compatibility with other tools ([RequireJS][requirejs], [Grunt][grunt]).\n  - Converting images to `data-uri` via some sort of flag in the property.\n  - [Source map][source-maps-html5rocks] generation ([more explanation][source-maps-snugug]). Mozilla [has a nodejs package][moz-source-map].\n\n\n  [nodejs]: http://nodejs.org/\n  [mqs]: http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/#media0\n  [copy-files]: https://gist.github.com/ryanfitzer/5202101\n  [CSSMin]: https://github.com/yui/ycssmin\n  [requirejs]: http://requirejs.org/\n  [grunt]: http://gruntjs.com/\n  [data-uri]:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/data_URIs\n  [source-maps-html5rocks]:http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/developertools/sourcemaps/\n  [moz-source-map]: https://github.com/mozilla/source-map\n  [source-maps-snugug]:http://snugug.com/musings/debugging-sass-source-maps\n"
