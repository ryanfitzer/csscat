  "readme": "# CSSCat #\n\nCSSCat is a [Node.js][nodejs] tool for managing CSS dependencies. Its goal is to facilitate CSS modularity through the liberal use of `@import` statements ([including ones with media conditions][mqs]) during development that can then be built into single files for production.\n\n**Why not just use one of the various CSS preprocessors available these days**, you ask? Good question. I wrote CSSCat for those who don't use a preprocessor and/or for when a project's limitations exclude a preprocessor as an option. Since CSSCat operates on valid CSS, switching to another tool is simple.\n\n**CSSCat IS IN THE ALPHA STAGES**. So please use with caution. Due to its file transformation functionality, it should only be used in a manner that does not jeopardize your valuable work. More testing and real-world use is needed to ensure a solid tool that functions as advertised.\n\nWith that said, testers are needed (and much appreciated)! Please log any issues or features and I'll follow up as soon as possible.\n\n\n## Features ##\n\n- Concatenates file dependencies by parsing their `@import` statements ([including ones with media conditions][mqs]). CSSCat correctly wraps the imported CSS in its equivalent `@media` block. For example:\n\n    **Before**:\n\n        @import url( 'a.css' ) screen and ( min-width: 100px );\n\n\n    **After**:\n\n        @media screen and ( min-width: 100px ) {\n        #some-id {\n            display:awesome;\n        }       \n        }\n\n- Rewrites relative asset paths to reference new context.\n- Optimizes each file via [CSSMin][CSSMin] (optional).\n\n\n## Installation ##\n\n    $ npm install csscat\n\n\n## Usage ##\n\n    var csscat = require( 'csscat' );\n    \n    csscat.init({\n        dir: 'path/to/css'\n    });\n    \n\n**Note**: CSSCat does not copy the files into a new directory before processing. This [gist][copy-files] shows how to use CSSCat's fs-helper in a build.js file to easily generate a copy of the original directory.\n\n## Options ##\n\n- `dir` {String} The base path (relative to the file from which `csscat.init` is invoked) used to search for all files with a \"css\" extension.\n\n- `files` {Array} (Optional) An array of files to use instead of searching the `dir` path. If the `dir` path is defined, the paths must be relative to the `dir` path.\n\n- `optimize` {Boolean} Minify via CSSMin.\n\n- `exclude` {RegEx} Regex exclusion pattern used to filter the list of files. Defaults to `/^\\.|\\/\\.|node_modules/`, which filters out anything that begins with \".\" or \"node_modules\". **NOTE**: If an excluded file is a dependency of a non-excluded file, the file will be parsed. This may change in the future.\n\n- `log` {Boolean} Enable logging. Defaults to `false`.\n\n- `debug` {Boolean} Enable debug logging. Defaults to `false`.\n\n\n## Testing ##\n\nWhile I develop more robust tests, I've created a simple smoke-test to be viewed in the browser. Viewing the results in the browser allows for easy debugging until I can get proper unit tests developed. If you find a particular scenario in your css that fails, let me know and I'll update the smoke-test. \n\n### Running the Smoke Test\n\n    $ cd path/to/where/you/installed/csscat\n    $ node smoke-test/test.sample\n\n### Viewing the Results\n\nA new directory will be created in the smoke-test directory named \"sample-build\". Open the enclosed \"index.html\" in a browser.\n\n### Reading the Results\n\n**PASS**: All text is green. A green checkmark image to the left of text.\n\n**FAIL**: Red text and/or red \"x\" image and/or no \"x\" image to the left of text.\n\n\n## Roadmap ##\n\n- More robust automated testing.\n- Compatibility with other tools ([RequireJS][requirejs], [Grunt][grunt]) (in progress).\n- Converting images to `data-uri` via some sort of flag in the property.\n- [Source map][source-maps-html5rocks] generation ([more explanation][source-maps-snugug]). Mozilla [has a nodejs package][moz-source-map].\n\n\n[nodejs]: http://nodejs.org/\n[mqs]: http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/#media0\n[copy-files]: https://gist.github.com/ryanfitzer/5202101\n[CSSMin]: https://github.com/yui/ycssmin\n[requirejs]: http://requirejs.org/\n[grunt]: http://gruntjs.com/\n[data-uri]:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/data_URIs\n[source-maps-html5rocks]:http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/developertools/sourcemaps/\n[moz-source-map]: https://github.com/mozilla/source-map\n[source-maps-snugug]:http://snugug.com/musings/debugging-sass-source-maps\n"
